# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Barcode Scanning System will enable users to quickly add books to their library by scanning ISBN barcodes using their device camera or by uploading images from their gallery. This feature will integrate seamlessly with the existing AddBooksPage, providing a third method for book addition alongside the current "Search Online" and "Manual Entry" options. The system will leverage the react-zxing library for barcode detection and the existing Google Books API integration for metadata retrieval.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to scan book barcodes with my device camera so that I can quickly add books to my library without typing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I navigate to the "Scan Barcode" tab on the Add Books page THEN I SHALL see a camera interface with live video preview
2. WHEN I point my camera at a book barcode THEN the system SHALL automatically detect and decode the barcode
3. WHEN a valid ISBN barcode is detected THEN the system SHALL automatically search for the book using Google Books API
4. WHEN book metadata is found THEN the system SHALL display a preview card with book details and an "Add to Library" button
5. WHEN I click "Add to Library" THEN the book SHALL be added to my collection with the same flow as other addition methods
6. WHEN the camera cannot access the device THEN I SHALL see a clear error message with alternative options

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to upload barcode images from my gallery so that I can add books even when I don't have the physical book with me.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I am on the "Scan Barcode" tab THEN I SHALL see an option to "Upload Image" alongside the camera interface
2. WHEN I click "Upload Image" THEN the system SHALL open the device's file picker for image selection
3. WHEN I select an image containing a barcode THEN the system SHALL process the image and attempt to decode the barcode
4. WHEN a valid ISBN is found in the uploaded image THEN the system SHALL search for book metadata using Google Books API
5. WHEN no barcode is detected in the image THEN I SHALL see a helpful error message suggesting image quality improvements
6. WHEN the image processing fails THEN I SHALL see appropriate error handling with retry options

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the barcode scanning interface to be intuitive and consistent with the app's design so that it feels like a natural part of the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view the scanning interface THEN it SHALL use the same shadcn/ui components and color scheme as the rest of the application
2. WHEN I use the camera interface THEN it SHALL have a clean, minimal design with clear visual indicators for the scanning area
3. WHEN scanning is in progress THEN I SHALL see appropriate loading states and visual feedback
4. WHEN a barcode is detected THEN I SHALL see clear visual confirmation before the book search begins
5. WHEN the interface is displayed on mobile devices THEN it SHALL be fully responsive and touch-friendly
6. WHEN I switch between camera and upload modes THEN the transition SHALL be smooth and intuitive

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear feedback during the scanning process so that I understand what's happening and can take appropriate action.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I start the camera THEN I SHALL see a loading indicator while the camera initializes
2. WHEN the camera is active THEN I SHALL see a scanning overlay with instructions on how to position the barcode
3. WHEN a barcode is detected THEN I SHALL see immediate visual feedback indicating successful detection
4. WHEN the system is searching for book metadata THEN I SHALL see a loading state with progress indication
5. WHEN an error occurs THEN I SHALL see specific, actionable error messages
6. WHEN a book is successfully added THEN I SHALL see confirmation feedback consistent with other addition methods

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the scanning feature to handle various barcode formats and edge cases gracefully so that it works reliably with different types of books.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I scan ISBN-10 barcodes THEN the system SHALL successfully decode and search for the book
2. WHEN I scan ISBN-13 barcodes THEN the system SHALL successfully decode and search for the book
3. WHEN I scan EAN-13 barcodes (which include ISBNs) THEN the system SHALL extract the ISBN and search for the book
4. WHEN a scanned barcode doesn't correspond to a book in Google Books API THEN I SHALL see a message offering manual entry as an alternative
5. WHEN multiple barcodes are detected in the camera view THEN the system SHALL prioritize the most centered and clear barcode
6. WHEN scanning conditions are poor (low light, blurry) THEN I SHALL see helpful tips for improving scan quality

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the scanning feature to respect my privacy and device permissions so that I feel secure using the camera functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I first access the scanning feature THEN the system SHALL request camera permission with a clear explanation
2. WHEN I deny camera permission THEN I SHALL still be able to use the image upload functionality
3. WHEN camera access is denied THEN I SHALL see a clear message explaining how to enable permissions
4. WHEN using the camera THEN no images or video SHALL be stored or transmitted except for barcode processing
5. WHEN processing uploaded images THEN the images SHALL be processed locally and not stored permanently
6. WHEN I navigate away from the scanning interface THEN the camera stream SHALL be properly stopped and resources released

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want the scanning feature to integrate seamlessly with the existing book addition workflow so that the experience is consistent across all addition methods.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I successfully scan a book THEN it SHALL appear in the "Recently Added" section just like books added through other methods
2. WHEN I add a scanned book THEN it SHALL trigger the same event logging as other addition methods
3. WHEN I scan a book that's already in my library THEN I SHALL see the same duplicate detection behavior as other addition methods
4. WHEN scanning fails to find a book THEN I SHALL have the option to switch to manual entry with any detected ISBN pre-filled
5. WHEN I add multiple books through scanning THEN the UI SHALL update consistently with the same patterns as batch additions
6. WHEN errors occur during scanning THEN they SHALL be handled through the same error handling system as other features
