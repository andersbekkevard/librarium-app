# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses the critical need for comprehensive test coverage in the Librarium personal library management application. Currently, the application has significant gaps in test coverage with multiple skipped tests and missing test scenarios for core user workflows. The goal is to achieve full test coverage while ensuring all tests validate the intended functionality and user experience of the app.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Test Coverage Analysis and Remediation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to identify and fix all problematic tests so that the test suite accurately reflects the application's behavior and provides reliable feedback.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing the current test suite THEN all skipped tests (it.skip, xdescribe, xit) SHALL be either fixed, rewritten, or removed with justification
2. WHEN running the test suite THEN all tests SHALL pass without being skipped
3. WHEN examining test failures THEN the root cause SHALL be identified as either test implementation issues or actual code defects
4. IF a test reveals a code defect THEN the code SHALL be fixed to match intended behavior
5. IF a test is incorrectly written THEN the test SHALL be rewritten to properly validate the intended functionality

### Requirement 2: Core User Workflow Test Coverage

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive tests for all core user workflows so that I can confidently deploy changes without breaking essential functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user authenticates with Google OAuth THEN the authentication flow SHALL be fully tested including success and error scenarios
2. WHEN a user manages their book library (add, edit, delete, view) THEN all CRUD operations SHALL be tested with proper validation
3. WHEN a user tracks reading progress THEN state transitions and progress updates SHALL be validated according to the reading state machine
4. WHEN a user views their dashboard THEN statistics calculation and display SHALL be tested for accuracy
5. WHEN a user searches and filters books THEN all filter combinations and search scenarios SHALL be tested
6. WHEN a user interacts with the Google Books API THEN API integration SHALL be tested with mocked responses
7. WHEN Firebase operations occur THEN all database interactions SHALL be tested with proper error handling

### Requirement 3: Component Integration Testing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want integration tests that validate how components work together so that I can catch issues that unit tests might miss.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing React components THEN provider contexts (AuthProvider, BooksProvider, UserProvider) SHALL be properly mocked and tested
2. WHEN testing page components THEN navigation and routing behavior SHALL be validated
3. WHEN testing form components THEN user input validation and submission SHALL be tested
4. WHEN testing data display components THEN proper data transformation and rendering SHALL be validated
5. WHEN testing error scenarios THEN error boundaries and error handling SHALL be tested

### Requirement 4: Business Logic Validation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want tests that validate the core business rules so that the application behaves according to its intended design.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing reading state transitions THEN the state machine rules SHALL be enforced (not_started → in_progress → finished)
2. WHEN testing book progress updates THEN progress validation SHALL ensure currentPage ≤ totalPages and ≥ 0
3. WHEN testing user statistics THEN calculations SHALL be accurate based on book states and user data
4. WHEN testing book ratings THEN validation SHALL ensure ratings are between 1-5 stars
5. WHEN testing event logging THEN all user actions SHALL be properly recorded with correct timestamps and data

### Requirement 5: User Experience Validation

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to behave consistently and intuitively so that I can manage my book library effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user adds a book THEN the book SHALL appear in their library with correct default values
2. WHEN a user starts reading a book THEN the state SHALL change to "in_progress" and appear in currently reading section
3. WHEN a user finishes a book THEN statistics SHALL update and the book SHALL appear in finished books
4. WHEN a user searches for books THEN results SHALL be filtered and sorted according to their criteria
5. WHEN a user views book details THEN all information SHALL be displayed accurately with proper formatting
6. WHEN errors occur THEN users SHALL receive appropriate feedback and the application SHALL remain stable

### Requirement 6: Performance and Reliability Testing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want tests that validate performance characteristics and error handling so that the application remains reliable under various conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing Firebase operations THEN timeout scenarios and network errors SHALL be handled gracefully
2. WHEN testing component rendering THEN loading states SHALL be properly displayed during async operations
3. WHEN testing large datasets THEN pagination and filtering SHALL perform efficiently
4. WHEN testing concurrent operations THEN data consistency SHALL be maintained
5. WHEN testing edge cases THEN the application SHALL handle invalid data and unexpected inputs safely

### Requirement 7: Test Infrastructure and Maintainability

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a maintainable test infrastructure so that tests remain valuable and easy to update as the application evolves.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN writing tests THEN test utilities and mocks SHALL be reusable across multiple test files
2. WHEN testing Firebase operations THEN a consistent mocking strategy SHALL be used
3. WHEN testing React components THEN proper setup and teardown SHALL be implemented
4. WHEN running tests THEN they SHALL be fast, reliable, and independent of each other
5. WHEN adding new features THEN test patterns SHALL be established that can be easily followed
