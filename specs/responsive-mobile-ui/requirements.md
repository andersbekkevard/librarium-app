# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on refactoring the existing UI to be fully responsive and mobile/tablet friendly while maintaining complete functional equivalence with the current laptop/desktop experience. The implementation will use modern React and Next.js best practices with a centralized responsive design system, ensuring excellent user experience across all device types without any horizontal scrolling or poor mobile UX patterns.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want the application to be fully functional and visually appealing on my mobile device, so that I can access all features without compromising usability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the application on a mobile device THEN the application SHALL render with appropriate mobile-optimized layouts
2. WHEN a user interacts with any feature on mobile THEN the functionality SHALL be identical to the desktop version
3. WHEN a user views content on mobile THEN there SHALL be no horizontal scrolling required
4. WHEN a user navigates the application on mobile THEN all interactive elements SHALL be appropriately sized for touch interaction
5. IF a user rotates their device THEN the application SHALL adapt gracefully to the new orientation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a tablet user, I want the application to utilize the available screen space effectively while maintaining touch-friendly interactions, so that I have an optimal experience between mobile and desktop layouts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the application on a tablet THEN the layout SHALL utilize tablet-specific breakpoints and spacing
2. WHEN a user interacts with components on tablet THEN touch targets SHALL be appropriately sized
3. WHEN content is displayed on tablet THEN it SHALL make efficient use of the available screen real estate
4. IF the tablet is in landscape mode THEN the layout SHALL adapt to show more content horizontally

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a centralized responsive design system, so that responsive behavior is consistent across components and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing responsive behavior THEN there SHALL be a centralized system for breakpoints and responsive utilities
2. WHEN components need responsive behavior THEN they SHALL use the centralized system rather than hardcoded values
3. WHEN new components are added THEN they SHALL easily integrate with the responsive system
4. IF breakpoints need to be modified THEN changes SHALL be made in one central location

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want a toggleable sidebar navigation, so that I can access navigation while preserving screen space for content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is on mobile THEN the sidebar SHALL be hidden by default
2. WHEN a user taps the menu toggle button (three lines icon) THEN the sidebar SHALL slide in from the left
3. WHEN the sidebar is open and user taps outside or the toggle button THEN the sidebar SHALL close
4. WHEN the sidebar is open on mobile THEN it SHALL overlay the content without pushing it
5. IF the user is on desktop THEN the sidebar SHALL remain visible and the toggle button SHALL be hidden

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user viewing the landing page on mobile, I want all content to be easily readable and visually appealing, so that I can understand the application's value proposition.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the landing page on mobile THEN all text SHALL be legible without zooming
2. WHEN a user scrolls through the landing page on mobile THEN all sections SHALL be properly formatted
3. WHEN images are displayed on mobile THEN they SHALL scale appropriately without breaking layout
4. WHEN interactive elements are present THEN they SHALL be touch-friendly sized
5. IF there are hero sections THEN they SHALL adapt to mobile viewport heights

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user viewing book data on mobile, I want all information to be easily accessible and readable, so that I can effectively manage my library on any device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views book cards on mobile THEN all essential information SHALL be visible and readable
2. WHEN a user views book lists on mobile THEN the layout SHALL adapt to show appropriate information density
3. WHEN a user views book details on mobile THEN all data SHALL be accessible without horizontal scrolling
4. WHEN a user interacts with book management features on mobile THEN all functionality SHALL work identically to desktop
5. IF book cards need modification for mobile THEN they SHALL maintain all functional capabilities

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user on any device, I want the application to use modern responsive design techniques, so that I have a cutting-edge mobile web experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application renders THEN it SHALL use CSS Grid and Flexbox for modern layout techniques
2. WHEN responsive behavior is implemented THEN it SHALL use container queries where appropriate
3. WHEN touch interactions are needed THEN modern touch event handling SHALL be implemented
4. WHEN animations are present THEN they SHALL be optimized for mobile performance
5. IF the device supports advanced features THEN the application SHALL utilize them appropriately

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to maintain zero functional changes on desktop, so that my existing workflow is not disrupted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the application on desktop THEN the experience SHALL be identical to the current version
2. WHEN desktop users interact with features THEN there SHALL be no behavioral changes
3. WHEN desktop layouts are rendered THEN they SHALL match the existing design exactly
4. WHEN responsive changes are applied THEN they SHALL only affect mobile and tablet viewports
5. IF any desktop functionality appears different THEN it SHALL be considered a regression

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to follow the existing structural system, so that code quality and maintainability are preserved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN responsive components are implemented THEN they SHALL follow the existing component structure
2. WHEN new utilities are added THEN they SHALL be placed in appropriate directories following current patterns
3. WHEN styling is modified THEN it SHALL use the existing design system and conventions
4. WHEN responsive logic is added THEN it SHALL integrate with existing providers and contexts
5. IF new patterns are introduced THEN they SHALL be consistent with the current architectural approach
