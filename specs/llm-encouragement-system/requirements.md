# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature integrates Firebase AI Logic with Gemini LLM to provide personalized encouragement messages throughout the reading tracker application. The system will display contextually relevant, supportive messages on key pages (Dashboard, My Library, Statistics) to enhance user engagement and motivation. Messages will be cached and refreshed strategically to balance personalization with performance.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see personalized encouragement messages on key pages, so that I feel motivated and supported in my reading journey.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I visit the Dashboard page THEN the system SHALL display a personalized encouragement message relevant to my current reading activity
2. WHEN I visit the My Library page THEN the system SHALL display a personalized encouragement message related to my book collection and reading goals
3. WHEN I visit the Statistics page THEN the system SHALL display a personalized encouragement message based on my reading progress and achievements
4. WHEN my reading has been on track lately THEN the Statistics page SHALL display a "nice work" or congratulatory message
5. WHEN my reading has been less active THEN the Statistics page SHALL display gentle encouragement to continue reading

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the encouragement messages to have a consistent visual design across all pages, so that I recognize them as coming from the same AI assistant.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN encouragement messages are displayed THEN they SHALL have a distinct visual style that fits the overall application design
2. WHEN encouragement messages are displayed THEN they SHALL include an appropriate LLM/AI icon for visual consistency
3. WHEN I navigate between Dashboard, My Library, and Statistics pages THEN the encouragement message format SHALL be visually consistent across all pages
4. WHEN I see an encouragement message THEN it SHALL be clearly distinguishable from other UI elements while maintaining design harmony

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want encouragement messages to be relevant and fresh without causing performance issues, so that I have a smooth experience with meaningful content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I log into the application THEN the system SHALL generate new encouragement messages for all pages
2. WHEN I log out and log back in THEN the system SHALL refresh all encouragement messages
3. WHEN a new day begins THEN the system SHALL automatically refresh encouragement messages
4. WHEN encouragement messages are cached THEN they SHALL be reused until the next refresh trigger occurs
5. WHEN the system generates messages THEN it SHALL use my current reading data, progress, and activity patterns as context

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear and configurable logic for when encouragement messages are refreshed, so that I can easily modify the refresh behavior in the future.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the message refresh logic THEN the system SHALL have clearly documented configuration for refresh triggers
2. WHEN I need to modify refresh behavior THEN the system SHALL provide easy-to-understand configuration options
3. WHEN the system determines if messages need refreshing THEN it SHALL use configurable criteria (login events, time-based triggers)
4. WHEN debugging message refresh issues THEN the system SHALL provide clear logging of refresh decisions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the AI messages to be contextually relevant to each page's purpose, so that the encouragement feels meaningful and appropriate.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the Dashboard THEN the encouragement message SHALL reference current reading status, recent activity, or upcoming goals
2. WHEN viewing My Library THEN the encouragement message SHALL reference book collection, reading variety, or library organization
3. WHEN viewing Statistics THEN the encouragement message SHALL reference reading achievements, progress trends, or goal completion
4. WHEN the AI generates messages THEN it SHALL use page-specific context and user data to create relevant content
5. WHEN no relevant data is available THEN the system SHALL display generic but supportive encouragement messages

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to handle AI service failures gracefully, so that my app experience isn't disrupted when the LLM service is unavailable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Firebase AI Logic service is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display fallback encouragement messages
2. WHEN AI message generation fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and use cached messages if available
3. WHEN no cached messages exist and AI service fails THEN the system SHALL display predefined fallback messages
4. WHEN AI service is restored THEN the system SHALL resume generating personalized messages on the next refresh cycle
5. WHEN displaying fallback messages THEN they SHALL maintain the same visual format as AI-generated messages
